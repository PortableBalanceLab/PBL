    "\n",
    "The pins labeled GPIO can all be used as general-purpose input/output pins. In other words, any one of them can first be set to either an input or an output. If the pin is set to be an input, you can then test to see whether the pin is set to a “1” (above about 1.7V) or a “0” (below 1.7V). Note that all the GPIO pins are 3.3V pins and connecting them to higher voltages than that could damage your Raspberry Pi. When set to be an output, the pin can be either 0V or 3.3V (logical 0 or 1). Pins can only supply or sink a small amount of current (assume 3mA to be safe), so they can just light an LED if you use a high value resistor (say, 470Ω or higher).\n",

    "#### 3.1.2 Serial Interface Pins <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"Ch312\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that some of the GPIO pins have other letters after their names. Those pins can be used as normal GPIO pins, but also have some special purpose. For example, pins 2 and 3 have the extra names of SDA and SCL. These are the clock and data lines, respectively, for a serial bus type called I2C that is popular for communicating with peripherals such as temperature sensors, LCD displays, and the like.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPIO pins 14 and 15 also double as the TXD and RXT (Transmit and Receive) pins for the Raspberry Pi’s serial port. Yet another type of serial communication is possible through GPIO 9 to 11 (MISO, MOSI, and SCLK). This type of serial interface is called SPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.3 Power Pins <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"Ch313\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Both GPIO connectors are sprinkled with pins labeled GND (ground). These pins are all connected to the Raspberry Pi’s ground or zero volts. Other power pins are also provided for 3.3V and 5V. You will often use these pins when hooking up external electronics to the Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.4 Hat Pins <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"Ch314\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Two special pins, only available on the 40-pin variant of the Raspberry Pi, are ID_SD and ID_SC. These are reserved for an advanced interface standard that you can use with the Raspberry Pi 2, B+ and A+. The standard is called HAT (Hardware Attached to Top). This standard does not in any way stop you just using GPIO pins directly; however, interface boards that conform to the HAT standard can call themselves HATs and have the advantage that a HAT must contain a little EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) chip on it that is used to identify the HAT so that ultimately the Raspberry Pi could auto-install necessary software. The pins ID_SD and ID_SC are used to communicate with a HAT EEPROM.\n",

    "#### 3.1.5 Breadbarding with Jumper Wires  <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"Ch315\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Solderless breadboard, often just called breadboard, is a great way of connecting electronics to a Raspberry Pi. There is no soldering to do—you just push electronic components into the breadboard and then connect them to your Raspberry Pi GPIO connector using either special jumper wires.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Digital Outputs <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"Ch32\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPIO pins can be used to generate a digital output signal, for example to switch a light on and off. To access the GPIO pins, you need to import a library called `RPi.GPIO`. This library is included with Raspbian, so you do not need to install it. You just need to import it into the console by entering the command below:\n",
    "   \n",
    "```python\n",
    "    import gpiozero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have a LED connected to the Raspberry Pi, you need to specify the GPIO pin number and whether the pin is an input or an output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    led = gpiozero.LED(18)\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 3.3 Analog Outputs - Pulse Width Modulation <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"Ch33\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The method used by the `gpiozero` library to produce an “analog” output is called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The GPIO pin actually uses a digital output, but generates a series of pulses. The width of the pulses are varied. The larger the proportion of the time that the pulse stays high, the greater the power delivered to the output, and hence the brighter the LED.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-2.png](images/pulse_modulation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The proportion of the time that the pulse is HIGH is called the duty and this is often expressed as a percentage. Even though the LED is actually turning on and off, it happens so fast that your eye is just fooled into thinking the LED is brighter or dimmer depending on the length of the PWM pulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Digital Inputs <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"Ch34\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Where an LED is the most likely thing to be connected to a digital output, a switch is probably the most likely thing to be connected to a digital input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Analog Inputs <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"Ch35\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the Raspberry Pi does not have analog inputs, that is inputs that can measure a voltage rather than simply tell if it is above or below a threshold that indicates the input is high or low. A lot of analog sensors provide an output voltage that is proportional to the thing they are measuring. So, for example, a temperature sensor chip such as the TMP36 has an output pin whose voltage varies depending on the temperature. The only way to use such a sensor with the Raspberry Pi is to use an __ADC (Analog to Digital Convertor)__ chip.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, many sensors are resistive. That is, their resistance changes with the thing they are measuring. A thermistor’s resistance changes with temperature and a photoresistor’s resistance varies depending on the amount of light falling on it. Other types of resistive sensors include gas sensors, strain sensors, and even resistive touch screens. These “resistive” sensors can be used with a Raspberry Pi by timing how long it takes for current to flow through the resistive sensor and charge up a capacitor to the extent that it crosses the threshold of a digital input so that the input counts as HIGH rather than LOW\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.5.1 measuring resistance <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"Ch351\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the following use case:\n",
    "![image-3.png](images/resistance_setup.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how this works, it can help to think of the capacitor as a water tank, the wires as pipes and the resistors, and the photoresistor as faucets that restrict the flow of water in the pipes. First the capacitor is emptied of charge (the tank is emptied of water) by setting pin 23 to be an output and low. The charge then drains out of the capacitor through R2. R2 is there to make sure the charge doesn’t flow out and into the Pi so fast that it damages the GPIO pin. Next, pin 23 is effectively disconnected by setting it to be an input and pin 18 is set high (3.3V) so that the capacitor starts to fill through both the fixed resistor R1 and the photoresistor. The voltage at the capacitor will then start to rise as the capacitor fills. The capacitor will fill faster the lower the resistance of the photoresistor. This voltage is now monitored by pin 23 now acting as an input until the input goes high at about 1.65V (half of 3.3V). The time taken for this to happen is measured and can then be used to calculate the resistance of the photoresistor, which is an indication of the light level.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-5.png](images/oscilloscope.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure above a) shows an oscilloscope trace of the voltage at pin 23 as the capacitor charges. The horizontal axis is time and the vertical axis volts, b) shows the same thing but with the photoresistor covered so that it is darker (and higher resistance). As you can see, it takes perhaps three times as long for the voltage to rise in the dark.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a capacitor is charged through a resistor, the time taken for the capacitor voltage to rise to 0.632 of the charging voltage is called the time constant (T). By the miracle of physics, T is also equal to the value of resistance times the capacitance. So, you can work out T from the time taken to charge to 1.65V (t) using the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    T = t*3.3*0.632\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because we know how long it got to 1.65V we just need to scale that up a bit to see how long it would take to get to 3.33.3 × 0.632 = 2.09V. You now have a definite value for T.\n",
    "Now you also know that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    T = (R+R1)xC\n",
    "    \n",
    "where R is the photoresistor’s resistance. Rearranging these, you get:\n",
    "\n",
    "    R = (T/C)-R1\n",
    "    \n",
    "Which is the value of resistance of the photoresistor."
