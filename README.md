> Portable Balance Lab course material for students

The Portable Balance Lab (PBL) is a practical course that teaches people how to create their own balance lab by integrating sensors with software. This repository contains all of the learner-facing course material.


## Getting Started

In this course, we will work with Python. To get used to this, all lectures are delivered through Jupyter notebooks. This way, you can view, modify, and run all code samples in the Jupyter viewer (i.e. just like Matlab Livescripts).

- **Download a Copy of this Repository**:

    1. [Download link](archive/main.zip)
    2. Unzip it somewhere - all course materials are inside it

- **Get Jupyter**:

    1. Download and Install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
    2. Boot the Anaconda Navigator (e.g. via the Start bar)
    3. Boot Jupyter through the navigator UI
    4. This should open Jupyter a browser window. Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) can be opened through this UI.

- **Open a PBL Lecture**:

    1. In the Jupyter UI, browse to wherever you unzipped this repository:

        * e.g. #1 click `Downloads` then `pbl-main`
        * e.g. #2 click `Desktop` then `pbl-main`
        * e.g. #3 click `OneDrive` then `Desktop` then `pbl-main`

    2. Browse to a specific lecture `.ipynb` file

         * e.g. click `PBL start-up session (students) (21-22)` then `PBL_Lab0_Manual_2022.ipynb`

Once you are satisfied that you can load a Jupyter notebook, you can then go through the course materials.


## Course Materials

It is recommended that you go through all of the lecture material (prefixed: `L`).

| ID | Name | Link |
| -- | ---- | ---- |
| L1 | Set up the Raspberry Pi | [PBL start-up session](PBL start-up session) |
| L2 | Python: Basics | Link TODO |
| L3 | Python: functions, classes, and writing files | Link TODO |
| L4 | Python: GUIs and Hardware Interfacing | Link TODO |

You will be asigned one of four possible lab practicals (prefixed: `P`). You only need to study the material that you have been assigned.

| ID | Name | Link |
| -- | ---- | ---- |
| P1 | Camera | Link TODO |
| P2 | IMU | Link TODO |
| P3 | Force Plate | Link TODO |
| P4 | EMG | Link TODO |


## F&Q

### Where is the Schedule?

This repository only contains core course materials. Schedules should be made available by your teachers via their teaching platform of choice (e.g. in TU Delft, Brightspace).
