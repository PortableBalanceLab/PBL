> Portable Balance Lab course material for students

The Portable Balance Lab (PBL) is a practical course that teaches people how to create their own balance lab by integrating sensors with software. This repository contains all of the learner-facing course material.


## Getting Started

In this course, we will work with Python. To get used to this, all lectures are delivered through Jupyter notebooks. This way, you can view, modify, and run all code samples in the Jupyter viewer (i.e. just like Matlab Livescripts).

- **Download a Copy of this Repository**:

    1. [Download link](archive/main.zip)
    2. Unzip it somewhere - all course materials are inside it

- **Get Jupyter**:

    1. Download and Install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
    2. Boot the Anaconda Navigator (e.g. via the Start bar)
    3. Boot Jupyter through the navigator UI
    4. This should open Jupyter a browser window. Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) can be opened through this UI.

- **Open a PBL Lecture**:

    1. In the Jupyter UI, browse to wherever you unzipped this repository:

        * e.g. #1 click `Downloads` then `pbl-main`
        * e.g. #2 click `Desktop` then `pbl-main`
        * e.g. #3 click `OneDrive` then `Desktop` then `pbl-main`

    2. Browse to a specific lecture `.ipynb` file

         * e.g. click `PBL start-up session (students) (21-22)` then `PBL_Lab0_Manual_2022.ipynb`

Once you are satisfied that you can load a Jupyter notebook, you can then go through the course materials.


## Course Materials

### `L`: Lectures

It is recommended that you go through all of the lecture material (`L0`-`L3`). These ensure you know enough Python to get through the practical material (`S0`-`S4`).

| ID | Link |
| -- | ---- |
| L1 | Python: Basics |
| L2 | Python: functions, classes, and writing files |
| L3 | Python: GUIs and Hardware Interfacing |

### `S`: Sensor Practicals

You will be asigned one of four possible lab practicals (`S2`-`S5`). All lab practicals require setting up the Raspberry Pi (`S1`). After setting up the Raspberry Pi, you only need to use the materials related to the practical you have been assigned (`S2`-`S5`).

| ID | Link | Note |
| -- | ---- | ---- |
| S1 | Set up the Raspberry Pi | **All lab practicals (`S2`-`S5`) require doing this first** |
| S2 | Camera | |
| S3 | IMU | |
| S4 | Force Plate | |
| S5 | EMG | |

### `E`: Extras

TODO: these are how we will code things like extra python examples, standalone FAQ Jupyter notebooks, etc.


## F&Q

### Where is the Schedule?

This repository only contains core course materials. Schedules should be made available by your teachers via their teaching platform of choice (e.g. in TU Delft, Brightspace).
