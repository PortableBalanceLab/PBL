> Portable Balance Lab course material for students

The Portable Balance Lab (PBL) is a practical course that teaches students how to integrate hardware and software in order to create their own balance lab. This repository contains all of the student-facing PBL course material.


## Getting Started

In this course, we will work with Python. To get used to this, all lectures are delivered through Jupyter notebooks. This way, you can view, modify, and run all code samples in the Jupyter viewer (i.e. just like Matlab Livescripts).

- **Download a Copy of this Repository**:

    1. [Download link](archive/main.zip)
    2. Unzip it somewhere - all course materials are inside it

- **Get Jupyter**:

    1. Download and Install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
    2. Boot the Anaconda Navigator (e.g. via the Start bar)
    3. Boot Jupyter through the navigator UI
    4. This should open Jupyter a browser window. Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) can be opened through this UI.

- **Try Opening a PBL Lecture**:

    1. In the Jupyter UI, browse to wherever you unzipped this repository:

        * e.g. #1 click `Downloads` then `pbl-main`
        * e.g. #2 click `Desktop` then `pbl-main`
        * e.g. #3 click `OneDrive` then `Desktop` then `pbl-main`

    2. Browse to a specific lecture `.ipynb` file

         * e.g. click `PBL start-up session (students) (21-22)` then `PBL_Lab0_Manual_2022.ipynb`

Once you are satisfied that everything is working, you can then go through the course materials.
