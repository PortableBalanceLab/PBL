    "An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is a device consisting of an accelerometer, gyroscope, and often a magnetometer. By combining the information from the accelerometer – gravitational acceleration – with the data from the gyroscope – rotational velocity -, the orientation of the device can be determined. The magnetometer is used to track the magnetic-north, to determine the heading of the IMU. There are many commercially available IMUs on the market ( [ref: human-motioncapture website](https://human-motioncapture.com/measurement-systems/inertial-sensor-measurement-systems/)). The seperate sensors in an IMU can also be used to detect alterations in human motions. The accelerometer can for example be used to track body sway. \n",

    "In this lab we will work with the Sense HAT. This HAT is specially designed for the Raspberry Pi Zero. Apart from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, the board has a barometer, and temperature and humidity sensors. More information on the board and example code can be found [here](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Sense_HAT_(B)).\n",
