    "# `S2`: Sensor Lab 2: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is a device consisting of an accelerometer, gyroscope, and (often) a magnetometer. By combining the information from the accelerometer--gravitational acceleration--with the data from the gyroscope--rotational velocity--the orientation of the device can be determined. The magnetometer is used to track the magnetic-north which determines the heading of the IMU.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many commercially available IMUs on the market (e.g. [Human Motion Capture](https://human-motioncapture.com/measurement-systems/inertial-sensor-measurement-systems/)). When combined, the sensors in an IMU can also be used to detect alterations in human motions. For example, the accelerometer can be used to track body sway.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will work with the Sense HAT. This HAT is specially designed for the Raspberry Pi Zero. In addition to the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, the Sense HAT also has a barometer, and temperature and humidity sensors. More information on the board and example code can be found [here](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Sense_HAT_(B)).\n",
