    "# `X1`: Extra Content 1: Writing CSV Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Comma Seperated Values (CSVs) is a term used to refer to a computer file containing tabular data that is presented in plain text. It is extremely common because it is human-readable, easy-to-understand, and easy for computers to read/write.\n",
    "\n",
    "All sensor practicals (`S1-S4`) in the PBL course involve writing CSV data. Anything you see in this extra note should be considered part of the practical exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ℹ️ **Example**: `S2` contains a step that involves writing IMU data to a CSV file. Consequently, it recommends reading this material and, subsequently, will assume you are familiar with all of this content.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a CSV File?\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSV file is a text file that contains tabular data. Each line in the file is a row in the table, and commas seperate each column within a row. E.g. this table, rendered via Jupyter:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Name | Course | Year | Grade |\n",
    "| ---- | ------ | ---- | ----- |\n",
    "| Nikhil | KT2502 | 2022 | 9.0 |\n",
    "| Sanchit | KT2501 | 2021 | 7.1 |\n",
    "| Awkward, Name | KT2502 | 2022 | 5.0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Can be represented as CSV data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "Name,Course,Year,Grade\n",
    "Nikhil,KT2502,2022,9.9\n",
    "Sanchit,KT2501,2021,7.1\n",
    "\"Awkward, Name\",KT2502,2022,5.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using a CSV is that it is more machine-readable than a fancy-looking Jupyter table. CSV files are so common that a wide variety of applications can read them. E.g. you could save the above in Notepad and import it as a table into Microsoft Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `csv` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "> ℹ️ **Note**: CSV may appear to be so simple that you'd be tempted to write your own CSV writer. For example, by `open`ing a file and `file.write(row)`ing each row yourself. However, this isn't recommended.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Custom CSV writers may not handle edge-cases properly. E.g. in the above example, your code might write invalid data if your input data contains a comma. It might write invalid data if your input data contains a combination of commas and double quotes, etc. - just use the `csv` module for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because CSV files are so popular, python includes a `csv` module. The `csv.writer` class is used to write data to a CSV file. This class returns a writer object which is responsible for converting the user’s data into a delimited string. A `csvfile` object should be *opened* with `newline=''`, otherwise newline characters inside the quoted fields will not be interpreted correctly. Therefore, we need to slightly adjust the code we put in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `csv.writer` class provides two methods for writing to CSV. They are `writerow` and `writerows`. `writerow` writes **a single row** at a time. `writerows` is used to write **multiple rows** at a time. Below is an example of how to write data into a csv file:"
