    "# `S3`: Sensor Lab 3: Portable Forceplate\n",
    "\n",
    "Force plates (or force platforms) are instruments that measure the ground reaction forces generated by a body standing on or moving across them. They are commonly used to quantify balance, gait and other parameters of biomechanics in medicine and sports.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest force plates measure only the vertical component of the force in the geometric center of the platform. More advanced models measure the three-dimensional components of the single equivalent force applied to the surface and its point of application, usually called the centre of pressure (CoP).\n",

    "In this portable lab you will be working with a very simple CoP forceplate consisting of four [force sensors](https://www.kiwi-electronics.nl/nl/load-sensor-50kg-2813?language=nl-nl&currency=EUR&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxtSSBhDYARIsAEn0thTvnI1bd6WQD_von2DZ8tOxBhw2jOA-A8ubldtaUDM1Rzt_mVxNFhoaAveIEALw_wcB) coupled to [HX711 amplifiers](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13879) ([further info on load cells](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-load-cells)).\n",

    "### 3.2 Calibrate the Force Plate <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"Ch32\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The HX711 Load Cell ADC amp doesn't measure force directly. Instead, it produces a signal (a number) that changes when the force applied to the plate changes. Therefore, an [external calibration](https://www.adamequipment.com/aeblog/internal-calibration-vs-external-calibration) is necessary to map those signals to forces (or weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each HX711 must be calibrated separately. This is because each load cell isn't necessarily identical, which creates variance in raw measurements when compared to the weight that is applied to each load cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ℹ️ **Example**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Placing a one kilogram on the force plate and reading data from one of the HX711s may return a value (signal) of `5000`. This implies that a signal of `5000` maps to `1 kg`. Assuming a linear relationship between the signal and the weight, the weight multiple for that HX711 is therefore `5000`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Placing the same one kilogram weight on the force plate and reading data from a different HX711 may return a value of (e.g.) `5500`. This implies that a signal of `5500` maps to `1 kg` for the other HX711. Weight multiples are permitted to be different for each load cell due to differences in manufacturing tolerence and assembly.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> So, when using four HX711s, you will need to use your calibration (weight multiples) to map four signals (e.g. `5000`, `5500`, `4900`, and `3000`) onto weights/forces (e.g. `1 kg`, `1 kg`, `1 kg`, and `1 kg`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `hx711-multi` library comes with a calibration script (`tests/calibrate.py`) that you can use to compute the **calibration values** of **each** HX711 load cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each load cell (e.g. the one attached to `DU1`):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove all weight from the plate\n",
    "- Change to the `hx711-multi` directory: `cd /opt/hx711-multi`)\n",
    "- Run `tests/calibrate.py` in a terminal (via `python3 tests/calibrate.py`) or from your editor (e.g. Mu)\n",
    "- The `calibrate.py` script will prompt you to `Enter SCK/Clock pin`.\n",
    "- Enter the pin on the Raspberry Pi you attached the `Clk` pin on the motherboard to (default: `17`)\n",
    "- The `calibrate.py` script will prompt you to `Enter DOut/Measurement pin`.\n",
    "- Enter the pin on the Raspberry Pi that you attached one of the load cell's data pin on the motherboard (e.g. if `DU1` is attached to GPIO pin `22` on the Pi then you should type `22`)\n",
    "- When prompted, place a **known** weight on the corner of the plate that corresponds to your load cell\n",
    "- When prompted, enter the weight, in kilograms, into the program\n",
    "- The program will then print a calibration value. This is a value you can use to convert a signal from the HX711 to a measurement in Kg. **You should note this value down - you'll be using it in your experiments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a more accurate calibration value, you can change the weight to other known values three times. After the third time, just press enter without entering any value as a known weight. The program will then provide you with an average calibration value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Warning**: Remember to note down the calibration value for **each** load cell.\n",

    "In biomechanics, center of pressure (CoP) is the term given to the point of application of the ground reaction force vector. The ground reaction force vector represents the sum of all forces acting between a physical object and its supporting surface. Analysis of the center of pressure is common in studies on human postural control and gait. Changes in motor control are reflected in changes in the center of pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A forceplate can be used to track the CoP during standing balance. Commercial forceplates (e.g. [Kistler](https://www.kistler.com/en/product/type-9286b/)) have four three-dimensional force sensors in the four corners of the plate. These forceplates are quite expensive (around >10k). In your setup the force sensors are one-dimensional sensors, measuring forces in a single direction only: perpedicular to the forceplate. \n",
