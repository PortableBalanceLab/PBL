    "### 2.2 Navigating with the terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find yourself using three commands a lot when you are using the command line. The first command is `pwd`, which is short for `p`rint `w`orking `d`irectory. It prints which directory you are currently in. You can run `pwd` by typing it after the `$` sign in the terminal window:\n",

    "$ ls\n",

    "The final command we are going to cover is `cd`, which is short for `c`hange `d`irectory. `cd` is used to naviagate the filesytem by changing the current directory (the thing printed by `pwd`). It can change the directory relative either to the old working directory or to a completely different directory if you specify the whole directory, starting with /.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 `sudo`\n",

    "You might be wondering why, as the sole user of this computer, you are not automatically a super-user. The answer is that, by default, your regular user account (username: `pi`, password: `raspberry`) does not have privileges that, say, allow you to go to some vital part of the operating system and start deleting files. Instead, to cause such mayhem, you have to prefix those commands with `sudo`. This just adds a bit of protection against accidents. For the commands we have discussed so far, you will not need to prefix them with `sudo`. However, just for interest, try typing the following:\n",
