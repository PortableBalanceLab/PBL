    "> This is useful because it means you can control the Pi without having to attach a monitor, keyboard, etc. - which is ideal for workflows where your Pi needs to remotely perform a task (e.g. measuring EMG signals).

    "### 4.3 `sudo`  <a id=\"sudo-cmd\" />\n",

The answer is that, by default, your regular user account (username: `pi`, password: `raspberry`) does not have privileges that, say, allow you to go to some vital part of the operating system and start deleting files. Instead, to cause such mayhem, you have to prefix those commands with `sudo`. This just adds a bit of protection against accidents.
