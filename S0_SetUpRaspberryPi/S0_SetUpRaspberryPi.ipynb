You might be wondering why, as the sole user of this computer, you are not automatically a super-user. The answer is that, by default, your regular user account (username: pi, password: raspberry) does not have privileges that, say, allow you to go to some vital part of the operating system and start deleting files. Instead, to cause such mayhem, you have to prefix those commands with sudo. This just adds a bit of protection against accidents. For the commands we have discussed so far, you will not need to prefix them with sudo. However, just for interest, try typing the following:\n",
